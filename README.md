# Apple ADB Mouse Model

I made this model because I wanted one of the rainbow Apple emblems in my Apple ADB mouse for my Apple IIGS. This may not work for your Apple ADB mouse because there are so many different variations of the same mouse, but mine was the model G5431 made in Malaysia.

This is not an entirely original model, I took an already existing model, and had to make  quite a few modifications to get it to work with my mouse. Thankfully the model was already open source, so it was easy to modify.
